# Vazlio for Node.js
Are you having difficulties loosing weight and live a sedentary lifestyle? Many weightloss apps don't provide an accurate portrayal of how many calories you need to eat to lose weight. When I used Noom, they stated that my weightloss zone was 2250 to 3000 calories. However, when I listened to that I just kept gaining weight. Vazlio provides a more accurate portrayal of your daily calorie expenditure by allowing you to set your own diet and exercise scheduel for the week. It uses the Mifflin St. Jeor equation to calculate your basal metabolic rate (BMR) and takes into account how medications might reduce your BMR. With this program you will finally know whether your diet will truly result in weightloss.
